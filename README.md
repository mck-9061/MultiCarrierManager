# Multi Carrier Manager
A simple C# Windows Forms app to aid in managing multiple Fleet Carriers in Elite Dangerous.
<br>
Owning multiple carriers in this game requires the use of alt accounts, so this app allows you to view stats about carriers across multiple accounts.

##Features
* View name, callsign, credits, fuel, current system and other stats for multiple carriers.
* Manage as many of your own carriers as you want.
* View cargo and market data for your carriers.
* Get carrier data from Frontier's API.

##Limitations
* This only works on Windows and probably won't be ported to anything else.
* It also only works with PC accounts, though it does work with both Horizons and Odyssey.
